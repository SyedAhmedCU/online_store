# Syed's Gift Shop - Online Store Web application
- I used server-side programming using Express web application framework and it was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, Node.js and MongoDB.
- Customers can order products by filling up a web form. The informations are validated on the server side and also stored in a database.
- Customers get a receipt and they can also submit a request along with a photo.
- There is an admin panel which allowes business owner to view all the receipts and requests and edit/delete the requests.
- The admin panel requires log in and the dashboard will redirect the user to the login page if its logged out.
